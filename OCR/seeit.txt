Recommendations

Recommendations Comment : History: Patient is a 35 year old male who was admitted to [U Health Arnett on
12/12/2015 due to headache. Head CT showed intracranial hemorrhage within a past surgical site. The patient has a
history of cerebral melanoma in the right temperal love with resection x3 and chemotherapy. The patient had a right
temperal lobe craniotomy on 12/14/2015. Head CT on 12/15/2015 showed status post evacuation of right temperal
hematoma with reduced mass effect. Dysphagia evaluation was ordered by Dr. Gehring. The patient is currently on a
clear liquid diet.

Patient with reported reduced movement of upper lip. Patient's RN reported the patient's night nurse was able to give
medications to patient whole, in applesauce followed by ice-chips.

The patient has not had previous dysphagia or signs of aspiration with intake. The patient's wife reported the patient
had a Clinical bedside evaluation in 2009 after a surgery. However, at that time the patient did not have any oral
motor deficits as he is presenting with now. She stated the patient has always been slowly upgraded in diet/oral
intake after surgeries. The patient's wife did report that the patient made a little more rounding of lips this morning to
give her a kiss than yesterday.

Evaluation: The patient was alert and oriented to self. He appeared aware of the situation and fearful. He calmed to
reassurance by his wife.

The patient attempted to follow directions for oral motor evaluation. The patient was unable to retract or protrude lips.
He was unable to close lips to hold air in mouth or keep bolus in oral cavity. Tongue with slight deviation to the left.
Reduced strength bilaterally with external pressure observed. Palate with reduced movement on the left upon
vocalization. Cough was sharp and respiratory drive was strong. Patient's speech was 100% intelligible, imprecise
articulation was noted. Patient with left upper and lower extremity paresis.

Oral care was completed. Patient was repositioned as upright as possible. He was given ice-chips x3. Patient used
teeth to hold ice in oral cavity while retrieving from the spoon. Patient flexed head backwards to use gravity to aid
with retrieval of bolus from the spoon. Reduced bolus contro! was observed with reduced lingual manipulation
abilities. The patient had to use his finger x1 to move ice from buccal cavity to more midline oral cavity for tongue to
manipulate. Impulsive mastication and swallow noted. Laryngeal elevation palated. Patient with 1-2 swallows per
ice-chip trial. Patient with similar oral motor and swallow function with 1/2tsp, and 1 tsp water x5. No overt signs of
aspiration were noted. Patient was then handed the cup to attempt cup sip. Patient was aided with clinican using
hand over hand technique. Patient with reduced ability to control bolus flow from cup and coordinate lingual
movements. Immediate coughing was observed. Suspected spill of bolus posteriorly into pharynx prior to pharyngeal
swallow trigger and airway protection. Patient consumed 20z of applesauce in 1/2tsp amounts fed by clinician. He
was also observed with 3 pills, whole one at a time in applesauce. Swallow again was similar to ice and 1/2tsp, tsp

* Final Report *

water. Patient used his right hand to close lips around the spoon. No observed signs/symptoms of aspiration were
noted. No lingual residue was observed after the 20z of applesauce.

Impressions: Patient presents with reduced oral motor abilities and observed moderate-severe oral dysphagia.
Given patient's recent intracranial hemorrhage and craniotomy with resulting oral motor deficits, further evaluation of
swallow function is warranted radiographically. As the patient is reported to have some increased movement of lips
today compared to yesterday, timing of swallow study should be considered and patient may benefit from holding off
on study for a few days awaiting spontaneous recovery.

Recommendations:

Consider short-term alternative nutrition/hydration with limited intake of puree and thin liquids via spoon with 100%
feeding by RN or wife.

Aggressive oral care at least once every 2 hours & before any oral intake.

Diagnostic therapy with Speech to assess oral motor and swallowing functions to determine appropriate timing for
videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS).

RN was provided with information. Dr. Gehring was contacted via phone and was to be provided information by
nurse.
